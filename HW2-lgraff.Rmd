```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Load shapefile
```{r cars}
FL_counties <- readOGR("FL_eviction_counties.geojson")
plot(FL_counties)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
